## -description

The *NdkDisconnectEventCallbackEx* (*NDK_FN_DISCONNECT_EVENT_CALLBACK_EX*) function is called by the NDK provider once when the peer disconnects.

## -parameters

### -param DisconnectEventContext

[in, optional]
A context area that was specified in the *DisconnectEvent* parameter of the *NdkCompleteConnectEx* ([NDK_FN_COMPLETE_CONNECT_EX](nc-ndkpi-ndk_fn_complete_connect_ex.md)) or *NdkAcceptEx* ([NDK_FN_ACCEPT_EX](nc-ndkpi-ndk_fn_accept_ex.md)) function when the completion queue (CQ) object was created.

### -param ProviderDisconnectReason

[in]
A provider specific code that indicates why the connection has disconnected.

**Zero** indicates the NDK provider does not support the disconnect reason capability yet or did not provide one. 

## -remarks

> [!NOTE]
> This routine is implemented by the NDK consumer and passed to the NDK provider.

*NdkDisconnectEventCallbackEx* is a callback function for connection disconnect events.  A disconnect notification callback function is specified for a connection with the *NdkCompleteConnectEx* ([NDK_FN_COMPLETE_CONNECT_EX](nc-ndkpi-ndk_fn_complete_connect_ex.md)) function on the initiator side and with the *NdkAcceptEx* ([NDK_FN_ACCEPT_EX](nc-ndkpi-ndk_fn_accept_ex.md)) function on the listener side. The NDK provider invokes this callback only once when the peer disconnects. The provider should not flush outstanding work requests when it indicates a disconnect event because of an incoming disconnect request from the peer.
