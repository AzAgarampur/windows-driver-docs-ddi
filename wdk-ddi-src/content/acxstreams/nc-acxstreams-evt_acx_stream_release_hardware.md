## -description

The EvtAcxStreamReleaseHardware event tells the driver to release any hardware allocated for the stream and put the stream into the Stop state. 

## -parameters

### -param Stream

An ACXSTREAM object represents an audio stream created by a circuit. The stream is composed of a list of elements created based on the parent circuitâ€™s elements. For more information, see [ACX - Summary of ACX Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/acx-summary-of-objects).

## -returns

Returns `STATUS_SUCCESS` if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code. For more information, see [Using NTSTATUS Values](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-ntstatus-values).


## -remarks

An AcxStream supports different states. These states indicate when audio is flowing (RUN state), audio is not flowing but audio hardware is prepared (PAUSE state), or audio is not flowing and audio hardware is not prepared (STOP state).

The EvtAcxStreamReleaseHardware event will transition the stream state from the Pause state to the Stop state. The driver should release any hardware resources that were allocated for streaming in this event, such as DMA engines. Once the stream is in the Stop state, the driver may receive the [EvtAcxStreamPrepareHardware](nc-acxstreams-evt_acx_stream_prepare_hardware.md) event to transition to the Pause state or the ACXSTREAM object may be destroyed.

ACX Events are analogous to KS states as described in this table.

| Start State | End State | ACX Driver Event Called | Notes                                                 |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| STOP        | ACQUIRE   | PrepareHardware         | Driver performs hardware allocations and preparations |
| ACQUIRE     | PAUSE     | (No Call)               |                                                       |
| PAUSE       | RUN       | Run                     |                                                       |
| RUN         | PAUSE     | Pause                   |                                                       |
| PAUSE       | ACQUIRE   | (No call)               |                                                       |
| ACQUIRE     | STOP      | ReleaseHardware         | Driver releases hardware allocations                  |

### Example

Example usage is shown below.

```cpp
    ACX_STREAM_CALLBACKS streamCallbacks;
    ACX_STREAM_CALLBACKS_INIT(&streamCallbacks);
    streamCallbacks.EvtAcxStreamReleaseHardware = EvtStreamReleaseHardware;
    ...
    status = AcxStreamInitAssignAcxStreamCallbacks(StreamInit, &streamCallbacks);
```

```cpp
PAGED_CODE_SEG
NTSTATUS
EvtStreamReleaseHardware(
    _In_ ACXSTREAM Stream
    )
{
    PSTREAM_CONTEXT ctx;
    NTSTATUS        status;

    PAGED_CODE();

    ctx = GetStreamContext(Stream);

    status = ReleaseStreamHardware(Stream);

    ctx->StreamState = AcxStreamStateStop;

    return status;
}
```
