## -description

The EvtAcxStreamGetPresentationPosition tells the driver to indicate the current position along with the QPC value at the time the current position was calculated. 

## -parameters

### -param Stream

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new ACXSTREAM Object.

An ACXSTREAM object represents an audio stream created by a circuit. The stream is composed of a list of elements created based on the parent circuitâ€™s elements. For more information, see [ACX - Summary of ACX Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/acx-summary-of-objects).

### -param PositionInBlocks

This is the position in blocks of the current stream (TBD?). This is a zero/one (TBD?) based position.

### -param QPCPosition

The query performance counter value  that provides a time stamp for the first audio frame in the data packet. This timestamp is expressed in 100-nanosecond (1000? TBD) units. This field can be set to null (zero?) if not being used (TBD?).

## -returns

Returns `STATUS_SUCCESS` if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code. For more information, see [Using NTSTATUS Values](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-ntstatus-values).



## -remarks

### Example

TBD - no sample driver code found

Example usage is shown below.

```cpp

```
