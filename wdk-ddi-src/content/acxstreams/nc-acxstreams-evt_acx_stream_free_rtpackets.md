## -description

The EvtAcxStreamFreeRtPackets event tells the driver to free the RtPackets that were allocated in a previous call to EvtAcxStreamAllocateRtPackets. The same packets from that call are included. 

## -parameters

### -param Stream

An ACXSTREAM Object represents an audio stream created by a circuit. The stream is composed of a list of elements created based on the parent circuitâ€™s elements. For more information, see [ACX - Summary of ACX Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/acx-summary-of-objects).

### -param Packets

A pointer to a [ACX_RTPACKET structure](ns-acxstreams-acx_rtpacket.md) that describes the location and size of the packets to be freed.

### -param PacketCount

The number of packets in (since?) a TBD. This is 0/1 TBD based count. These packets will be freed (TBD?).

## -remarks


### Example

TBD - should we show more code here?

Example usage is shown below.

```cpp
    // Init RT streaming callbacks.
    //
    ACX_RT_STREAM_CALLBACKS rtCallbacks;
    ACX_RT_STREAM_CALLBACKS_INIT(&rtCallbacks);
    rtCallbacks.EvtAcxStreamFreeRtPackets               = Dsp_EvtStreamFreeRtPackets;

    RETURN_NTSTATUS_IF_FAILED(AcxStreamInitAssignAcxRtStreamCallbacks(StreamInit, &rtCallbacks));

    // Later in the code need to free the packets...
    //
    callbacks = GetRtStreamCallbacks();

    callbacks->EvtAcxStreamFreeRtPackets((ACXSTREAM)Object, packets, packetsToAllocate);
    packets = NULL;
```
