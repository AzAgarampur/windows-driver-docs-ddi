## -description

The EvtAcxStreamGetCapturePacket tells the driver to indicate which packet (0-based) was completely filled most recently, including the QPC value at the time the driver started filling the packet. 

## -parameters

### -param Stream

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new ACXSTREAM Object.

An ACXSTREAM object represents an audio stream created by a circuit. The stream is composed of a list of elements created based on the parent circuitâ€™s elements. For more information, see [ACX - Summary of ACX Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/acx-summary-of-objects).

### -param LastCapturePacket

A value indicating the position of the last captured packet. This is a 0/1 TBD value. 

### -param QPCPacketStart

A value indicating the position of the last captured packet. This is a 0/1 TBD value. 


### -param MoreData

A PBOOLEAN value indicating of there is more data.

## -returns

Returns `STATUS_SUCCESS` if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code. For more information, see [Using NTSTATUS Values](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-ntstatus-values).
