## -description

The **AcxStreamStopIoActual** function is used to to signal to the operating system to temporarily stop stream IO. This allows the driver a short period of time to run time sensitive tasks, and then resume IO after the execution of time sensitive code is complete.

## -parameters

### -param Stream

A pointer to an existing ACXSTREAM Object. An ACXSTREAM Object represents an audio stream created by a circuit. The stream is composed of a list of elements created based on the parent circuitâ€™s elements. For more information, see [ACX - Summary of ACX Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/acx-summary-of-objects).

### -param Flags

TBD - The following flags are defined to TBD TBD.

TBD - Set to null as no flags are defined.

### -param ObjectTag

An optional ObjectTag that is a driver-defined value that the framework stores as an identification tag for the ACX driver.

### -param Line

The Line number in the driver code that can be displayed for diagnostic purposes.

### -param File

The file name in the driver code that can be displayed for diagnostic purposes.

## -returns

Returns `STATUS_SUCCESS` if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code. For more information, see [Using NTSTATUS Values](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-ntstatus-values).

## -remarks

It is not recommended to use this version of the stop IO call, but rather [AcxStreamStopIoWithTag](nf-acxstreams-acxstreamstopiowithtag.md).
