# _NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER structure


## -description

The NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER structure packages the object type, version, and size information that is
  required in many NDIS 6.0 structures.

## -struct-fields

### -field Type

The type of NDIS object that a structure describes. Use this member to identify the type of
     structure in a memory dump.

### -field Revision

The revision number of the structure. Every NDIS structure that has an NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER member
     has a revision number that applies to the NDIS structure exclusively. This allows NDIS drivers to
     support multiple versions of the same structure. For example, a driver can check the 
     <b>Revision</b> member value at run time and use the appropriate version of the structure.

### -field Size

The total size, in bytes, of the NDIS object structure that includes the NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER
     member. This size includes the size of the NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER member and the other members of the
     structure.

## -remarks

The reference page for every structure, that has an NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER structure as a member, defines
    values for the 
    <b>Type</b>, 
    <b>Revision</b>, and 
    <b>Size</b> members for that structure.
