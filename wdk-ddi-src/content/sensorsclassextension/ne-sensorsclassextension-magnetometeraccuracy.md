# MagnetometerAccuracy enumeration

## -description

Specifies the accuracy of the magnetometer.

## -enum-fields

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_UNKNOWN

The accuracy is currently not available, typically because the driver can't report it.

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_UNRELIABLE

The reported values have a high degree of inaccuracy. Apps should always ask the user to calibrate the device whenever this value is returned.

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_APPROXIMATE

The actual and reported values differ but may be accurate enough for some applications. Apps that only need a relative value, like a virtual reality app, can continue without additional calibration.

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_HIGH

The actual and reported values are accurate. No additional calibration is needed.

## -remarks

Device drivers that support magnetometer accuracy should only report the **MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_UNRELIABLE**, **MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_APPROXIMATE**, and **MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_HIGH** values.

Apps that need calibration may periodically ask the user to calibrate the device. We suggest doing this once every 10 minutes.
