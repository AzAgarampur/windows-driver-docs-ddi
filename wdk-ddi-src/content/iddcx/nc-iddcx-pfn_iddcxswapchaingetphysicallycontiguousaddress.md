**PFN_IDDCXSWAPCHAINGETPHYSICALLYCONTIGUOUSADDRESS** is a pointer to an OS callback function through which to retrieve the physical address of the specified swapchain's currently acquired surface.

## -parameters

### -param DriverGlobals

[in] Pointer to an [**IDD_DRIVER_GLOBALS**](./ns-iddcx-idd_driver_globals.md) structure containing system-defined per-driver data.

### -param SwapChainObject

[in] The [IDDCX_SWAPCHAIN](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/iddcx-objects) object passed to the [**EVT_IDD_CX_MONITOR_ASSIGN_SWAPCHAIN**](nc-iddcx-evt_idd_cx_monitor_assign_swapchain.md) call.

### -param pSurfaceAddresss

[out] Output arguments. On success, **pSurfaceAddress** is filled with the physical address of the surface.

## -returns

If the routine succeeds it return S_OK. If the surface was not allocated in physically contiguous memory this routine will return E_NOINTERFACE.

## -remarks

An indirect display driver (IDD) should not use this pointer to directly call the function that it points to. IDDs should instead call [**IddCxSwapChainGetPhysicallyContiguousAddress**](nf-iddcx-iddcxswapchaingetphysicallycontiguousaddress.md).
