## -description

**IddCxSwapChainReleaseAndAcquireSystemBuffer** releases and acquires buffers from the swapchain.

## -parameters

### -param SwapChainObject

[in] The [IDDCX_SWAPCHAIN](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/iddcx-objects) object used for querying the physical address of the currently acquired surface.

### -param pOutArgs

[out] Pointer to a [**IDARG_OUT_RELEASEANDACQUIRESYSTEMBUFFER**](ns-iddcx-idarg_out_releaseandacquiresystembuffer.md) structure in which the resulting information from the release and acquire operation is returned.

## -returns

**IddCxSwapChainReleaseAndAcquireSystemBuffer** returns S_OK on success; otherwise it returns an appropriate error code.

## -remarks

In addition to releasing and acquiring buffers from the swapchain, **IddCxSwapChainReleaseAndAcquireSystemBuffer** also unmaps and unlocks the buffer being released while mapping and locking the buffer being acquired. For this reason, it is not valid to call [**IddCxSwapChainReleaseAndAcquireBuffer**](nf-iddcx-iddcxswapchainreleaseandacquirebuffer.md) subsequent to calling this method. The [**IDDCX_SYSTEM_BUFFER_INFO**](ns-iddcx-iddcx_system_buffer_info.md) structure pointed to by **pBufferInfo** is filled with valid information only on a successful release and acquire as indicated by a return value of S_OK.
