# _BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL structure

## -description

The _BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL structure is used to open an enhanced L2CAP channel to a remote device, or send a response for accepting/rejecting an incoming enhanced L2CAP connection request that was initiated by a remote device.

## -struct-fields

### -field Hdr

A [BRB_HEADER](./ns-bthddi-_brb_header.md) structure that contains information about the current BRB.

### -field ChannelHandle

Handle used to identify the connection upon a successful connect. When sending a **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL**, this will be filled in when the BRB completes.  When sending a **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE** request, this must be filled in by the server before sending down the BRB. The value assigned should be `INDICATION_PARAMETERS::ConnectionHandle` which was passed in during the IndicationRemoteConnect.

### -field Response

Used only with **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE**. One of the CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_Xxx values is used.

If the BRB returns with a status of STATUS_REQUEST_NOT_ACCEPTED, then *Response* will contain the negative response from the remote host.

### -field ResponseStatus

If *Response* is equal to CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_PENDING, then this field is valid. One of the CONNECT_RSP_STATUS_XXX values is used.

### -field Psm

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| CF_LINK_AUTHENTICATED | The link must be authenticated. |
| CF_LINK_ENCRYPTED | The link must be encrypted. Setting this flag also sets the CF_LINK_AUTHENTICATED flag. |

If not set, the extra configuration options will be rejected as unknown options. This flag is used with **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL_RESPONSE** BRBs. |
| CALLBACK_CONFIG_EXTRA_OUT | If set, the callback routine will be called when the remote device rejects an extra configuration option from a **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL** request. If not set and the remote device rejects the configuration request due to an extra option, the connection will be closed. |
| CALLBACK_CONFIG_QOS | If set, the callback routine will be called when a remote device sends a configuration request that contains a QOS value. If this flag is not set and the remote device either sends QOS parameters in a configuration request or rejects the profile driver's requested QOS parameters, the connection is disconnected. |
| CALLBACK_DISCONNECT | If set, the callback routine will be called when a remote device disconnects from the enhanced L2CAP channel. |

#### Response

This member is used as an input parameter for a **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL** request and an output parameter for the **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL_RESPONSE** request.

For a **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL_RESPONSE** request, this member holds a flag that indicates the profile driver's response to the remote device. Valid flag values are contained in the following table.

| Flag | Description |

| CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_SECURITY_BLOCK | The profile driver refused the connection for security reasons. |
| CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_SUCCESS | The profile driver accepted the connection. |

For the **BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL** BRB, this member contains the response from the remote device to which the profile driver attempted to connect. Valid flag values are contained in the following table.

|Flag|Description|
|--- |--- |
|CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_NO_RESOURCES|The remote device refused the connection due to a lack of resources.|
|CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_PSM_NEG|The remote device refused the connection.|
|CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_SECURITY_BLOCK|The remote device refused the connection for security reasons.|
|CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_SUCCESS|The remote device accepted the connection.|

#### ResponseStatus

If during a call to the BRB_L2CA_OPEN_ENHANCED_CHANNEL_RESPONSE BRB the Response member is set to CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_PENDING, this member is valid and contains one of the following values:

- CONNECT_RSP_STATUS_AUTHENTICATION_PENDING

## -remarks

Profile drivers can use `CM_BASIC | CM_RETRANSMISSION_AND_FLOW`, or `CM_BASIC | CM_STREAMING` modes for the **Flags** member. This indicates to open an enhanced retransmission mode, or streaming mode channel if possible, and if not fall back to basic mode channel. 
A value of `CM_RETRANSMISSION_AND_FLOW | CM_STREAMING` is not supported.
