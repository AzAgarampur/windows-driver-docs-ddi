# DRIVER_DISPATCH callback function

## -description

The callback routine services various IRPs. For a list of function codes, see Remarks.

## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject

[in, out] Caller-supplied pointer to a [DEVICE_OBJECT](./ns-wdm-_device_object.md) structure. This is the device object for the target device, previously created by the driver's [AddDevice](./nc-wdm-driver_add_device.md) routine.

### -param Irp

[in, out] Caller-supplied pointer to an [IRP](./ns-wdm-_irp.md) structure that describes the requested I/O operation.

## -returns

If the routine succeeds, it must return STATUS_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it must return one of the error status values defined in Ntstatus.h.

## -remarks

Input parameters for all *Dispatch* routines are supplied in the [IRP](./ns-wdm-_irp.md) structure pointed to by *Irp*. Additional parameters are supplied in the driver's associated I/O stack location, which is described by the [IO_STACK_LOCATION](./ns-wdm-_io_stack_location.md) structure and can be obtained by calling [IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation](./nf-wdm-iogetcurrentirpstacklocation.md).

Generally, all *Dispatch* routines execute in an arbitrary thread context at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL, but there are exceptions. For more information, see [Dispatch Routines and IRQLs](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/dispatch-routines-and-irqls).

For more information about dispatch routines, see [Writing Dispatch Routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/writing-dispatch-routines). For more information about IRPs, see [Handling IRPs](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/handling-irps).

### Examples

To define a callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps [Code Analysis for Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers), [Static Driver Verifier](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier) (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a *DispatchCleanup* callback routine that is named `MyDispatchCleanup`, use the DRIVER_DISPATCH type as shown in this code example:

```cpp
DRIVER_DISPATCH MyDispatchCleanup;
```

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

```cpp
_Use_decl_annotations_
NTSTATUS
  MyDispatchCleanup(
    struct _DEVICE_OBJECT  *DeviceObject,
    struct _IRP  *Irp
    )
  {
      // Function body
  }
```

The DRIVER_DISPATCH function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the_Use_decl_annotations_annotation to your function definition. The_Use_decl_annotations_annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the DRIVER_DISPATCH function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see [Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-using-function-role-types-for-wdm-drivers). For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see [Annotating Function Behavior](/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-behavior).
