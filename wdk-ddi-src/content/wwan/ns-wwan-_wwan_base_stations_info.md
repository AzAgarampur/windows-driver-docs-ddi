The <b>WWAN_BASE_STATIONS_INFO</b> structure represents information about both serving and neighboring base stations.

## -struct-fields

### -field SystemType

Indicates the system type (or types) for which serving cell information is valid. This member is a bitmask of one or more system types as defined in the <b>WwanDataClass</b> member of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_device_caps">WWAN_DEVICE_CAPS</a>.

### -field SystemSubType

Indicates the 5G data subclass for which serving cell information is valid. This member is a bitmask of one or more system subtypes as defined in the <b>dataSubclass</b> member of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wwan/nf-wwan-is_5g_5gc_present">IS_5G_5GC_PRESENT</a>. This member is only valid when the **SystemType** field above indicates that 5G serving cell information is valid. Otherwise, this value should be **WWAN_DATA_SUBCLASS_NONE**.

### -field GSMServingCellOffset

### -field TDSCDMAServingCellSize

The size, in bytes, used for the buffer containing the TDSCDMA serving cell info, which is formatted as <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_tdscdma_serving_cell_info">WWAN_TDSCDMA_SERVING_CELL_INFO</a>.

### -field LTEServingCellOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing the LTE serving cell information. This member can be NULL when the technology of serving cell is not LTE.

### -field LTEServingCellSize

The size, in bytes, used for the buffer containing the LTE serving cell info, which is formatted as <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_lte_serving_cell_info">WWAN_LTE_SERVING_CELL_INFO</a>.

### -field GSMNmrOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing the GSM network measurement report. This member can be NULL when no GSM neighboring network is returned in the measurement report.

### -field GSMNmrSize

The size, in bytes, of the buffer containing the GSM network measurement report (NMR), which is formatted as <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_gsm_nmr">WWAN_GSM_NMR</a>.

### -field UMTSMrlOffset
